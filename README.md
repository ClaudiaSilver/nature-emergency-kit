# nature-emergency-kit
Inspired by Wes Bos' Drum Kit using plain JS.
Other than changing the theme from drum kit to nature sounds, I made the following changes/additions:
* changed styles and animations
* used sound files of varying lengths, therefore had to amend the transition function so their end would coincide with end of each audio track
* added toggle function so that sounds start and stop if key is clicked again
